This piece "Secret Land" is in A-minor. It consists of five sequences, each with different chord progressions. I use minor because it generates a soothing ambience and helps elicit a longing for peace and tranquility. The tempo starts at 60 beats per second and gradually decends after each loop to create the gentle, unrushed emotion.
