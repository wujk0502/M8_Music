This piece "Secret Land" is in A-minor. It consists of five sequences, each with different chord progressions. I use minor because it generates a soothing ambience and helps elicit a longing for peace and tranquility. The tempo starts at 60 beats per second and gradually decends after each loop to create the gentle, unrushed emotion. 

As the music is playing, the listener begins to slow down, breathe deeply and slowly, accept a bigger view of things, step out of the busy activities of the day, and enter another kind of time. I sought gentle tones to soothe the listener through carefully selected attack and release time. In additions, I attentively crafted the melody so that it coordinated with the chord progression and led to a 1+1>2 result. 

The five sequences each has its unique features, some lighter, others heavier, some having an intensifying ending, others descending to silence. I also use the same chord progression of each sequence to create the overlapping arpeggios to connect each sequence to generate a smoother transition. 

I hope you enjoy this "Secret Land" as you wonder in your heart's secret land!
